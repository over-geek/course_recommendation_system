Join us as we study the electrical properties in individual neurons, building a foundation for understanding the function of the entire nervous system.","course_syllabus":"Lesson1: The Resting Potential\nThe nervous system functions by sending electrical signals between neurons. To begin our study of the nervous system, we will focus on a single neuron 'at rest,' which has an electrical potential across its membrane. We will understand the ionic basis underlying this electrical potential, and how to calculate it ourselves. Lesson 2: Passive Membrane Properties\nElectrical signals between neurons can be sent through changes in their membrane potentials. In order to more deeply understand these electrical signals, we will first study the electrical properties of the neuron itself. We will examine the resistive and capacitive properties of the neuron, how these properties arise from biological factors, and how these properties influence how a neuron responds to electrical signals. Lesson3: Action Potentials\nIn this lesson we will investigate one of the fundamental ways that neurons send electrical signals, through an all-or-nothing process called the action potential. The action potential is generated by the precise opening and closing of voltage-gated channels that cause specific changes to the neuron's membrane potential. We'll develop an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of these channels and the ionic currents behind the action potential. Lesson 4: Action Potential Propagation\nNeurons send electrical signals through action potentials moving down their axons. In order to further develop our understanding of the way neurons generate and send electrical signals, we will integrate our knowledge of the electrical properties of the neuron and the action potential itself. This will allos us to understand how the nervous system has solved the problem of fast and reliable communication. Lesson 5: DIY Labs\nSeeing or measuring something with your own hands is often the best way to learn! We've spent a lot of time discussing the electrical properties of neurons, and along the way you've seen many different demonstrations. You can perform some of these experiments, as well as others we haven't shown yet, yourself, using an inexpensive piece of equipment known as a SpikerBox.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/fundamentals-of-neuroscience-part-1-the-electrical","text":"Fundamentals of Neuroscience, Part 1: The Electrical Properties of the Neuron Learn how electricity makes the neurons in your brain tick.

We'll then look at describing data for Task 1 of the test. You'll learn about what language to use to describe data, as well as how to select and group information. We'll also look at the language used for ordering ideas in paragraphs. In addition, this module offers the chance to practise writing the opening and data description paragraphs, which you can grade with our new assessment criteria. Additionally, you can get feedback on your writing from your peers and give them feedback using the IELTSx criteria. In preparation for Task 2, we're going to take a closer look at the essay question to help you answer all its parts and we will examine ways of planning and organising your essay. We'll also analyse the different parts of an IELTS essay, look in more detail at some possible task types in Task 2, and explain how they are assessed. We'll then look at how to write a good essay with good structure and appropriate language. Along the way, you'll have a chance to practise writing an introduction, body paragraphs and conclusion and submit these for assessment from other IELTSx students. There will also be practice of proofreading and editing.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/ielts-academic-test-preparation","text":"IELTS Academic Test Preparation Prepare for the IELTS Academic tests in this comprehensive, self-paced course covering listening, speaking, reading and writing.

This module will focus on one of the most commons ways to cook - adding energy in the form of heat to increase the temperature of a food andthus change its internal structure. Module 3: Phase transitions\nJoan and Jordi Roca of El Celler de Can Roca, recently voted thebest restaurant in the world, will explain how they manipulate phase transitions when cookingthrough techniqueslike sous vide and rotovapping. The scientific discussion will focus on what causes phase transitions in foods from a macroscopic and microscopic perspective. Module 4: Diffusion and Spherification\nJos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, chef and owner of minibar, Jaleo, and The Bazaar, will introduce us to the remarkable dishes he creates with gelling agents. Dominique Crenn of Atelier Crenn in San Fransisco will make carrot jerky, and America's Test Kitchen will show us their secret to making excellent scrambled eggs and coleslaw. Scientific discussions in this module will include gelation, modernist thickeners, and diffusion, which make some remarkable dishes possible. Module 5: Heat Transfer\nCarme Ruscalleda, chef and owner of restaurant Sant Pau, will cook steak and other culinary specialties that illustrate the special attention chefs pay to heat diffusion when cooking food. Nathan Myhrvold will share his method for cooking the perfect burger, and America\u2019s Test Kitchen will show us their secret to cooking perfect French fries. The scientific discussion in this module is about heat transfer, and explaining why it is so hard to cook a perfect steak from both a microscopic and macroscopic perspective. We will also explore heat-dependent chemical reactions, and how they impact food taste and texture. Module 6: Candy\nIn the final module we will discuss solubility and the science of candy and chocolate. Joanne Chang, from Flour bakery, will talk about the stages of sugar, and Enric Rovira from Xocolaters de Barcelona in Spain will show us some marvelous chocolate creations and we will discuss the underlying science of chocolate tempering and the different phases of chocolate.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/science-cooking-from-haute-cuisine-to-soft-matter","text":"Science & Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science (chemistry) Top chefs and Harvard researchers explore how everyday cooking and haute cuisine can illuminate basic principles in chemistry, physics, and engineering.

Learn where you\u2019re strongest and weakest, and if you have any commonly-held misconceptions. Week 2: Energy Overview\nForms of energy and common units of measurement. How energy flows through modern and historical economies, including the composition of energy supply, common energy transformations, and which sources are used for which purposes. Prices for energy around the world. Week 3: Estimating Costs\nThe quantitative techniques at the heart of the course: levelized cost and cost of mitigation. We\u2019ll apply these techniques to energy systems and also to everyday life. Week 4: Environmental Impacts\nHow severe are air pollution, climate change, and land use impact today, and how severe are they likely to be in the future? How do they affect human health, GDP, and the natural world? Week 5: Fossil Fuels\nAn abbreviated section focused on the abundance of fossil fuels. Spoiler alert: we won\u2019t run out any time soon. Week 6: The Electric Grid\nA brief overview of modern electric grids including major technologies they use, how remarkably reliable and efficient they are, how they\u2019re planned and regulated, and how they\u2019re starting to change. Week 7: Solar Power\nWhat solar power technologies dominate today and which have a chance to in the near future. How to estimate the cost of solar power in different regions, how it compares to other options, and the remarkable decline in its cost in the past 5 years. How we can cope with the intermittent nature of the solar resource. How solar power is regulated and subsidized today. Week 8: Nuclear Power\nHow nuclear fission works and how it\u2019s harnessed in modern nuclear plants. How much nuclear power costs and how much it\u2019s used, including the stagnation in its use since the 1990\u2019s and the prospects for its revival. Details on the hazards and costs of nuclear waste and power plant accidents. The connection between nuclear power and nuclear weapons. Week 9: Demand Reduction and Efficiency\nReducing energy demand, by changing behavior or making devices more efficient, can reduce environmental harms \u2013 sometimes while saving money! But are there limits to this strategy? Can humanity reduce demand and aim towards a lower-energy future?

This course will show you how inference and modeling can be applied to develop the statistical approaches that make polls an effective tool and we'll show you how to do this using R. You will learn concepts necessary to define estimates and margins of errors and learn how you can use these to make predictions relatively well and also provide an estimate of the precision of your forecast. Once you learn this you will be able to understand two concepts that are ubiquitous in data science: confidence intervals, and p-values. Then, to understand statements about the probability of a candidate winning, you will learn about Bayesian modeling. Finally, at the end of the course, we will put it all together to recreate a simplified version of an election forecast model and apply it to the 2016 election. https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/data-science-inference-and-modeling"},{"title":"Strengthening Community Health Worker Programs","summary":"Learn to deliver high-quality primary health care at scale through national community health worker programs.","n_enrolled":"58,626","course_type":"Self-paced on your time","institution":"Harvard University","instructors":"Rajesh Ramesh Panjabi","Level":"Introductory","subject":"Health & Safety","language":"English","subtitles":"English","course_effort":"2\u20134 hours per week","course_length":"6 Weeks","price":"FREE-Add a Verified Certificate for $79 USD","course_description":"Despite medical and technological advances, half of the world\u2019s population lacks access to essential health services, and over 8.9 million preventable deaths occur every year.

Are you involved in sports and do you want to have a better understanding of the role of nutrition on performance and health? Do you want to learn whether certain nutritional strategies could be relevant for your own athletic performance and\/or muscle growth? Are you a dietitian, physiotherapist or a health\/sport coach and do you want to be able to provide proper nutritional advice for your clients? Or, are you none of the above but interested in nutrition and sports and want to make your own informed decisions about your daily food intake?\nThen this online course is for you! Nutrition is crucial to live an active and healthy life, to support training, and to optimize performance. In this course, researchers and teachers from Wageningen University & Research will familiarize you with the nutritional aspects of exercise and sports. What are the basic concepts in exercise physiology and sport nutrition science? How is exercise being fueled for the different types of sports like; power sports, sprinting and endurance exercise? And how does protein support skeletal muscle mass and performance? In this course you will learn to estimate energy needs and understand thermoregulation and fluid balance. You will learn about the role of micronutrients and supplements in exercise performance. Moreover, you will be introduced to some health issues related to doing exercise.\nThis course also touches upon how the lessons learned from nutrition and sports research can be applied during ageing. For example, what are the benefits of extra protein in vulnerable age groups? Be aware that thiscourse will not tell you exactly what to eat. Instead, you will learn and understand the nutritional aspects of exercise and sport, so you can make your own informed decisions and critically evaluate nutritional advices and claims.

In this module, we examine how neurons pass signals to one another, and we explore how complex dynamics can result from even small numbers of neurons arranged in relatively simple circuits.\nLesson1: The Synapse\nThe junctions between neurons, called synapses, allow information to pass from one neuron to another. In lesson 1 \u201cThe Synapse,\u201d we explore what synapses are made of, and how they work. Lesson 2: Excitation & Inhibition\nSynapses can be grouped into two categories: synapses that increase the activity of the postsynaptic neuron are called excitatory synapses, while those that decrease its activity are called inhibitory synapses. In lesson 2 \u201cExcitation & Inhibition,\u201d we discuss the main differences between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Lesson 3: Small Circuits\nNeurons combine information from many synapses at once in a process known as synaptic integration. In lesson 3 \u201cSmall Circuits,\u201d we explore how a neuron integrates information from multiple synapses over time to allow complex signaling. Lesson 4: Neuromodulation\nHow many components are there in a synapse? You may think that the answer is simple: two, the presynaptic and the postsynaptic terminals. In lesson 4 \u201cNeuromodulation,\u201d we\u2019ll see that this is not entirely true: the strength of many synapses is directly influenced by a third neuron, in a process called neuromodulation. Lesson 5: Potentiation & DepressionOne of the most amazing properties of the nervous system is its ability to adapt and change in the face of a changing environment, a phenomenon called \"neuronal plasticity.\" Lesson 5, \u201cPotentiation and Depression,\u201d focuses on how neuronal plasticity occurs in the brain, and how it shapes the way we think and behave.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/fundamentals-of-neuroscience-part-2-neurons-and-ne","text":"Fundamentals of Neuroscience, Part 2: Neurons and Networks Discover how neurons work together to create complex networks inside the brain.

The motivating case study we examine in this course relates to the data-driven approach used to construct baseball teams described in Moneyball. We will try to determine which measured outcomes best predict baseball runs by using linear regression. We will also examine confounding, where extraneous variables affect the relationship between two or more other variables, leading to spurious associations. Linear regression is a powerful technique for removing confounders, but it is not a magical process. It is essential to understand when it is appropriate to use, and this course will teach you when to apply this technique. https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/data-science-linear-regression"},{"title":"HTML5 and CSS Fundamentals","summary":"Learn how to build Web sites using HTML5 and basic CSS, directly from W3C, creator of the latest Web standards.","n_enrolled":"335,895","course_type":"Self-paced on your time","institution":"The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)","instructors":"Marwa Hussein-Andrew Byrne-Adrian Leven-Gerry O'Brien","Level":"Introductory","subject":"Computer Science","language":"English","subtitles":"English","course_effort":"4\u20136 hours per week","course_length":"6 Weeks","price":"FREE-Add a Verified Certificate for $199 USD","course_description":"This course is part of W3C's \"Front-End Web Developer\" Professional Certificate.Learn the basics of Web design and style to give your Web sites a professional look and feel.

But instead of relying on the traditional \"theorem-proof\" format, we develop the material in an intuitive -- but still rigorous and mathematically-precise -- manner. Furthermore, while the applications are multiple and evident, we emphasize the basic concepts and methodologies that are universally applicable.The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including:The contents of this courseare heavily based upon the corresponding MIT class -- Introduction to Probability -- a course that has been offered and continuously refined over more than 50 years. It is a challenging class but will enable you to apply the tools of probability theory to real-world applications or to your research.This course is part of theMITx MicroMasters Program in Statistics and Data Science. Master the skills needed to be an informed and effective practitioner of data science. You will complete this course and three others from MITx, at a similar pace and level of rigor as an on-campus course at MIT, and then take a virtually-proctored exam to earn your MicroMasters, an academic credential that will demonstrate your proficiency in data science or accelerate your path towards an MIT PhD or a Master's at other universities.

In this module, we will look at the brain from a human-centric viewpoint, exploring how the various subsystems of the brain work, enabling us to survive and thrive in a changing world. Lesson 1: Vision\nOne of the most developed senses in humans is our vision. In lesson 1, \u201cVision,\u201d we take a deep dive into the visual system. How do we see, and more importantly, how do we understand what we see? Lesson 2: Audition\nOne of the many ways we communicate with one another and create community is through sound. In lesson 2, \u201cAudition,\u201d we will go on a journey that follows the path of sound waves as they are detected in the ear and processed in the brain. Lesson 3: Touch, Taste, Smell, and the Remaining Senses\nThere are more than just five senses in the animal kingdom. Consider eels with their ability to sense electric fields or vampire bats that can track down prey via infrared detection. In lesson 3, \u201cTouch, Taste, Smell, and the Remaining Senses,\u201d we explore both the remaining traditional senses - touch, taste, and smell - as well as some of the more unusual ones. Lesson 4: Movement and Action\nPerceiving the world is useless if we cannot act. The motor subsystems of the brain execute and coordinate our movement. In lesson 4, \u201cMovement and Action,\u201d we discuss how the nervous system makes your muscles contract in a coordinated manner, so that you can move and interact with your surroundings. Lesson 5: Subcortical Brain Areas\nWhile a highly-developed cortex is one of the key hallmarks of humanity, there's quite a bit more to the brain than cortex. In lesson 5, \u201cSubcortical Brain Areas,\u201d we explore the critical brain systems that keep us alive, help us orient to stimuli in our environment, and allow us to form new memories. Lesson 6: Brain Anatomy\nIn the last lesson of this course, \u201cBrain Anatomy,\u201d we wrap up our investigation of the brain with a closer look at the structures found in the sensory and motor systems in a real human brain.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/fundamentals-of-neuroscience-part-3-the-brain","text":"Fundamentals of Neuroscience, Part 3: The Brain Discover what makes your brain tick in this third course in our introductory series in neuroscience.

CitiesX will give you a far-ranging look at the past, present and future of cities, with the aim of teaching you how to better understand, appreciate and improve urban areas. The course will explore key concepts of urban development by examining cities around the world, including London, Rio de Janeiro, New York City, Shanghai, Mumbai, Kigali, and many more. The course includes a historical exploration of cities: how urban centers like ancient Rome resulted from consolidation of imperial power, how cities like Sao Paulo grew as important hotbeds of industry, and how cities like Seattle became hubs of technology and human capital. CitiesX also dives into pressing social and urban planning issues like public health, transportation, zoning, gentrification, cost of living, crime, and congestion. The course includes interviews and insights from academics, policy makers, urban leaders and city residents.

For the first time in human history, more than fifty percent of the world\u2019s population lives in urban areas. Cities allow for the exchange of ideas, and generate remarkable innovations in business, art, and ideas. Cities are also home to millions living in poverty. Urban living can provide a pathway to a better life, but that\u2019s not always the case for many people around the world. CitiesX will give you a far-ranging look at the past, present and future of cities, with the aim of teaching you how to better understand, appreciate and improve urban areas. The course will explore key concepts of urban development by examining cities around the world, including London, Rio de Janeiro, New York City, Shanghai, Mumbai, Kigali, and many more. The course includes a historical exploration of cities: how urban centers like ancient Rome resulted from consolidation of imperial power, how cities like Sao Paulo grew as important hotbeds of industry, and how cities like Seattle became hubs of technology and human capital. CitiesX also dives into pressing social and urban planning issues like public health, transportation, zoning, gentrification, cost of living, crime, and congestion. The course includes interviews and insights from academics, policy makers, urban leaders and city residents.

In the firstmodule of the course, we will explore the scientific concept of elasticity, which influences the texture of food, and how it changes during cooking. Discussions with Bill Yosses and Mark Ladner will address the role of gluten in dough and the challenges of working with gluten-free varieties. Module2: Viscosity\nHow can we make liquid foods more appealing? Just as solid foods can have different textures, so can liquids, largely determined by their viscosity, or thickness. Scientific discussions about what determines viscosity and demonstrations of different ways to change the viscosities of foods will allow us to explore this topic from different perspectives. We will hear from Harvard\u2019s own Martin Breslin, Director for Culinary Operations, and Carles Tejedor, from Oillab and By restaurant in Barcelona. Module3: Emulsions and Foams\nEmulsions and foams are some of the most interesting foods to think about from a scientific perspective, and we will investigate the physical principles that control their formation. Nandu Jubany will demonstrate how he uses emulsions and foams for a twist on traditional Catalan cuisine at his restaurant, Can Jubany. In the lab you can compete with other learners to see whose emulsion and foam rises the highest! Module4: Advanced Phase Behavior\nThe preparation of chocolate and frozen desserts such as ice cream are great illustrations of how chefs manipulate phase changes such as crystallization (freezing).In this module, we will discuss such concepts as nucleation of crystals and freezing point depression, and see how they can be used for chocolate tempering and making ice cream, which you will make yourself in the lab! Module5: Enzymes\nThe activity of enzymes can provide both benefits and challenges in the kitchen. After discussing the diverse roles that enzymes can play, we will investigate strategies to both restrict and exploit enzyme activity in cooking. Ted Russin and Wylie Dufresne will showcase some of their creative dishes that are only possible because of enzymes. Module6: Baking\nTo conclude the course, we will see how many of the topics that we have discussed come together in a popular cooking technique \u2013 baking! Joanne Chang and Christina Tosi will show us how to make delicious cakes, cookies, pies, and bread, and we will see how science makes it possible!","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/science-cooking-from-haute-cuisine-to-soft-matte-2","text":"Science & Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science (physics) Top chefs and Harvard researchers explore how traditional and modernist cooking techniques can illuminate basic principles in chemistry, physics, and engineering.

The module contextualizes these trends in WHO\u2019s ongoing transition from promoting a one-size-fits-all strategy to tailoring approaches according to local and regional epidemiological, environmental, and political contexts.  Module 2: The Biology of Malaria\nThis module provides foundational scientific knowledge for the course, including important biological aspects of the malaria parasite, the mosquito vector, and the human host. In this module\u2019s lecture, Professor Dyann F. Wirth begins with a brief overview of how malaria came to be understood, then goes into detail on the parasite\u2019s life cycle, how malaria affects humans, and the existing and sought-after tools to prevent and treat malaria. Finally, Professor Wirth reviews global endeavors to eradicate malaria.  Module 3: Vector Biology and the Dynamics of Malaria Transmission\nThis module focuses on the Anopheles mosquitoes that are the vector that transmit malaria to humans. Professor Flaminia Catteruccia discusses biological and anatomical features of mosquitoes that influence how the parasite is acquired from humans, develops in the mosquito, and is transmitted back to humans. Professor Catteruccia then discusses how current vector control strategies work, why they fail, and how improved understanding of vector biology can lead to improved vector and parasite control strategies.   Module 4: The Dynamics of Malaria Transmission\nIn the fourth module, the course delves deeper into the malaria transmission cycle, including how it can be interrupted. Professor Matthias Marti examines the cycle of malaria parasite transmission between humans and mosquitoes, including mechanisms of parasite sequestration in the human body, and the life cycle of the parasite in the mosquito. The module then applies these concepts to examine the dynamics of infectiousness and transmission. Finally, natural transmission-blocking mechanisms are considered in the context of the ongoing development of vaccines against malaria.  Module 5: Genomic Approaches to Malaria Elimination\nThis course module introduces learners to the contributions of the burgeoning field of genomics to understanding and controlling malaria. After introducing key genetic principles, Dr. Sarah Volkman uses data on genetics from Senegal, Panama, and Mozambique to describe how parasite populations are changing. Currently available genomic tools and methods, along with their application to inform key questions about malaria transmission, prevention, and treatment, are discussed.  Module 6: Social, Cultural, Behavioral, and Environmental Determinants of Malaria\nIn the sixth module, the course\u2019s focus shifts from the microscopic genes to a more global perspective. Using a systemic view of malaria, the module describes human and environmental factors that influence how malaria is manifested and how control efforts work. Professor Marcia Castro discusses various components of global \u2018systems\u2019 that enable the continued existence of malaria, and presents historical examples that exemplify the importance of these components. Professor Castro also describes the challenges and the opportunities in the struggle to eradicate malaria that these human and environmental factors create.  Module 7: Political Analysis for Malaria\nIn this module, the course presents another analytical approach that has been repeatedly shown to be necessary for successful malaria programming, as well as for public health more broadly. Professor Michael R. Reich approaches the topic of malaria control and eradication policy from the realm of politics. This module provides overviews of principles of applied political analysis and analysis methods that can be used to promote appropriate policy reforms. Professor Reich walks through the use of PolicyMaker, a free open-source political analysis software, analyzing case studies including one on the Affordable Medicines for Malaria Facility (AMFm).  Module 8: Malaria Control and Elimination: Surveillance-Response Approaches\nThis module discusses disease surveillance, a health system function essential to malaria elimination. Surveillance\u2014finding where and when transmission of infectious diseases takes place\u2014is critical for deciding where to target public health actions. In the lecture, Professor Marcel Tanner provides an in-depth examination of how to use monitoring and evaluation (M&E), surveillance-response, and data analysis effectively for malaria control and elimination. Using case studies from Zambia, China, the Pacific Islands and Tanzania, the module provides practical guidance on developing surveillance-response approaches and discusses how surveillance systems can be incorporated into public health programs.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/malariax-defeating-malaria-from-the-genes-to-the-g","text":"MalariaX: Defeating Malaria from the Genes to the Globe How can we eradicate malaria?

Instead, we offer a thorough and robust means of certifying edX learners in their mastery of the MITx introductory biology content, through a the MITx 7.00x Introduction to Biology Competency Exam. This challenging option is available only to those who register for the verified-certificate track, and successful completion of this exam is the only assessment that counts toward a certificate. We highly recommend preparing for the Competency Exam certification by using the current course materials and MIT OpenCourseWare problems. The next Competency Exam will be open October 27, 2020 to November 3, 2020.7.00x is an introductory level biology course hosted by professor Eric Lander, who was one of the leaders of the Human Genome Project. The course content reflects the topics taught in the MIT introductory biology courses and many biology courses across the world. As a learner, you will first focus on the structure and function of macromolecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins. You will discover how changes in the structure of some of these macromolecules alter their functions and what the implications of such changes have on human health. As you continue in the course, you will apply an understanding of heredity and information flow within cells to human health and disease and will learn about molecular biological techniques and their potential to impact our changing world. After you complete this course, you will have a foundation in biology that will allow you to understand the remarkable medical revolution going on today.MITx 7.00x: Introduction to Biology \u2013 The Secret of Life will let you explore the mysteries of biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, recombinant DNA technology and genomics, and rational medicine.

How can a country, founded more than 200 years ago on the ideals of liberty, equality, and individualism, still struggle to empower all of its citizens equally? This course explores the origins of U.S. political culture, how that culture informed the Constitution, and how that framework continues to influence the country\u2019s politics and policies. We will examine the Constitution\u2019s provisions for limited government, the division of power between the federal and state governments, and the forces that have made federalism a source of political conflict and change. We will address how the Constitution not only established the structure of the U.S. government but guarantees personal freedoms and civil rights. These rights have been challenged and expanded in significant Supreme Court cases, which will help to illustrate how historically disadvantaged groups have struggled to realize the 14th Amendment's promise of equality.","course_syllabus":"Week 1: Political Culture\nThis session will explore the origins of the nation\u2019s political culture, its embrace by each succeeding generation of Americans, and its continuing influence on the nation\u2019s politics and policies. U.S. welfare and education policy will be used to illustrate that influence. The session also highlights the nature of politics\u2014the process through which society settles its conflicts over scarce resources and conflicting values. Week 2:Limited Government\nThis session will examine the Constitution\u2019s provisions for limited government and then explore the extent to which these provisions have curbed constitutional abuses of power. The main points of the session will be reinforced by examining a set of cases, including the Watergate scandal, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, and the Bush Administration\u2019s handling of enemy detainees after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Week 3:Representative Government\nThis session will explore the reasons that the framers felt it necessary to limit popular influence, will describe how and why the original system changed, and will look at contemporary barriers\u2014gerrymandering, voter registration, and voter ID laws\u2014that inhibit voting. Week 4: Federalism\nThe session will explain the division of power between the federal and state governments and also explain how broadly worded constitutional clauses, partisan differences, and changing national needs have combined to make federalism a source of political conflict and change. Among the cases explored in this session is the constitutional dispute provoked by the 2010 healthcare reform act. Week 5:Civil Liberties\nThis session will examine these developments and explain the individual rights held by today\u2019s Americans. Major Supreme Court rulings\u2014such as those relating to free speech and protection from unreasonable search and seizure\u2014will be discussed as a means of clarifying Americans\u2019 civil liberties. Week 6: Civil Rights\nThis session will focus on three policies that have been instrumental in expanding the rights and opportunities of disadvantaged groups: the 14th Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause, the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and affirmative action. The last of these policies have been particularly contentious and we\u2019ll take a close look at it, including a recent Supreme Court ruling on a case involving the University of Texas at Austin.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/american-government-constitutional-foundations","text":"American Government: Constitutional Foundations Learn how early American politics informed the U.S. Constitution and why its promise of liberty and equality has yet to be fully realized. \u201cWe the People\u201d are the opening words of the U.S. Constitution, yet the original document did not give citizens much say in the election of their officials. Though some of those issues have been addressed, substantial barriers\u2014gerrymandering, voter registration, and voter ID laws\u2014still restrain the power of the vote. Why? How can a country, founded more than 200 years ago on the ideals of liberty, equality, and individualism, still struggle to empower all of its citizens equally? This course explores the origins of U.S. political culture, how that culture informed the Constitution, and how that framework continues to influence the country\u2019s politics and policies.

We will let you play around and create your own materials and ask you to come up with your first design proposal.Part 3: Aerospace StructuresThis part covers the essential structural elements of aircraft and spacecraft. The assignment involves studying the skeleton of your favorite aircraft or spacecraft to identify why certain structural elements were used by their designers.Part 4: Loads and StressesCovers the loads that act on the different aircraft parts, the paths these loads travel on through a structure, and how this affects design choices when designing wings and fuselages. We look at the consequences of pressurized fuselages and of bending of wing spars and how it impacts the design. At the end of this part, you will face your first dilemma as a designer: how to satisfy all the design requirements even if they appear contradictory.Part 5: Selection of Materials and StructuresThis part looks at the structural performance of aircraft and how to select the appropriate structural and materials solutions for a design problem based on stiffness and strength. The concepts of specific strength and specific modulus will be introduced. We will also take you through the basic steps on how to dimension a spacecraft.Part 6: Design, Certification, Fatigue and DurabilityIf you are a fan of those aircraft investigation shows on the television, you will most likely enjoy this module. However, we will also show you that life isn't quite like television, should you still be in any doubt. You will learn how, during the design process, many possibilities for failure are already eliminated, and the underlying philosophies for why. We will also discuss fatigue and damage tolerance, as they are critical if we want to monitor and improve the durability of aircraft and spacecraft.Part 7: Joining & ManufacturingIn this part we look at how aircraft and spacecraft are assembled, what joining methods are used and why. As your final assignment, you will choose a joining method for your aircraft based on a dilemma we will present you with!Part 8: Wrap UpAs always, no job is done until the paperwork is done. We ask you to look back at your initial expectations and see how far you have come.

Scrum embodies the simplest and most pure approach to managing project work at the team level. Scrum is employed by over half of all Agile practitioners across all industries. While agile may have started in software development, many industries now use an agile methodology to deliver their work. The basis for agile, the agile manifesto, extends well beyond its origins in extreme programming and agile software development. Development teams around the world are now using kanban boards and assigning strong product owners to direct self-organizing teams to deliver on prioritized product backlogs. And nearly every new product has some sort of IT component and goes through an agile development lifecycle.While the Mastering Agile Professional Certificate program emphasizes principles at the heart of all Agile frameworks, in this course we start by learning the key project management processes, roles, mechanics, and philosophies behind Scrum.

Scrum embodies the simplest and most pure approach to managing project work at the team level. Scrum is employed by over half of all Agile practitioners across all industries. While agile may have started in software development, many industries now use an agile methodology to deliver their work. The basis for agile, the agile manifesto, extends well beyond its origins in extreme programming and agile software development. Development teams around the world are now using kanban boards and assigning strong product owners to direct self-organizing teams to deliver on prioritized product backlogs. And nearly every new product has some sort of IT component and goes through an agile development lifecycle.While the Mastering Agile Professional Certificate program emphasizes principles at the heart of all Agile frameworks, in this course we start by learning the key project management processes, roles, mechanics, and philosophies behind Scrum.

All other Modules will be made available on September 8th. While you can complete the course at your own pace, the instructors will facilitate Live Sessions on a monthly basis -- as indicated below.Orientation Module:In this Introduction to u.lab, you will learn how to use and navigate the social and community elements of the course, and you will find some guidelines to get familiar with the edX platform.Module 1: Co-Initiating This module is the actual start of the course, and it consists of an introduction to the deeper sources of our current global challenges. You will learn about the art and practice of deep listening, and set your intention for the journey ahead. There will be a Live Session on September 24th that corresponds to Module 1.Module 2: Co-SensingTo sense into your current context, in this module you will learn how to gather data by suspending and listening through practices such as learning journeys and stakeholder interviews. The second half of this module will teach you how to make sense of the data you generate using Social Presencing Theater.Module 3: PresencingAt the bottom of the U, you will be guided to retreat and reflect, allowing deeper sources of knowledge to emerge by connecting with a future possibility that is in need of us. There will be a Live Session on October 22nd that corresponds to Module 3.Module 4: Co-CreatingTo move upwards after the profound phase of Presencing, in this module you will learn how to stay connected to your deeper sources of inspiration and pay attention in a way that will enable you to move from idea to action -- learning by doing. This module also describes practices to engage in prototyping activities to generate feedback that will help you evolve your inspiration \/ idea. In a nutshell, this module contains principles to support the evolution from an idea, to a prototype, to an initiative with the potential to scale.Module 5: Co-EvolvingWe all know about many episodes and stories of great transformational change and breakthrough. But at the end of the day they remain merely that: episodes. Sooner or later the larger system snaps back into the old way of operating. Unless the deeper root issues are addressed, transformational episodes may lack the conditions to spread across the remaining system. How to attend to these root issues while prototyping is the question we will explore in this Module. There will be a Live Session on November 19th that corresponds to Module 5.Module 6: The Journey AheadWhat is emerging globally from u.lab 1x and what is needed to carry momentum forward? What are the next steps in the u.lab journey? There will be a final Live Session on December 10th addressing these questions.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/ulab-leading-from-the-emerging-future","text":"u.lab: Leading From the Emerging Future An introduction to leading profound social, environmental and personal transformation.

You might keep track of stock prices, but how can you figure out how much money you've made (or lost) in the market? And you may already know how to tell time, but can you calculate at what times a clock's hour and minute hands are exactly aligned? With algebra, you can answer all of these questions, using the numbers you already know to solve for the unknown. Algebra is an essential tool for all of high school and college-level math, science, and engineering. So if you're starting out in one of these fields and you haven't yet mastered algebra, then this is the course for you! In this course, you'll be able to choose your own path within each lesson, and you can jump between lessons to quickly review earlier material. AlgebraX covers a standard curriculum in high school Algebra I, and CCSS (common core) alignment is indicated where applicable.Learn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/introduction-to-algebra"},{"title":"LaTeX for Students, Engineers, and Scientists","summary":"Explore a new way of writing and typesetting articles, books, papers, etc. using a document preparation system called LaTeX.","n_enrolled":"11,823","course_type":"Self-paced on your time","institution":"IITBombay","instructors":"Deepak B.

The learner creates the first document using LaTeX, organizes content into sections using article and book class of LaTeX. Topic 2: Styling Pages\nIn this topic, the session starts by reviewing different paper sizes, examines packages, formats the page by setting margins, customizing header and footer, changing the page orientation, dividing the document into multiple columns. The topic ends with reading different types of error messages. Topic 3: Formatting Content\nThis topic concentrates on formatting text (styles, size, alignment), adding colors to text and entire page, and adding bullets and numbered items. It concludes by explaining the process of writing complex mathematics. Topic 4: Tables and Images\nThe topic starts by creating basic tables, adding simple and dashed borders, merging rows and columns, and handling situations where a table exceeds the size of a page. The sessions then continue to add an image, explore different properties like rotate, scale, etc.. Topic 5: Referencing and Indexing\nIn this topic, the learner learns to add cross-referencing (refer to sections, table, images), add bibliography (references), and create back index.

We\u2019ll examine the 2013 government shutdown as a case study in party conflict. The session will also explain why Congress\u2019s fragmented structure makes it difficult for Congress to take the lead on major national issues while making it perfectly suited to taking on scores of smaller issues at once. Week 3: Presidents & Domestic Policy \nThis session will examine the factors that affect presidential success in the area of domestic policy. Several factors will be mentioned, but the focus will be the partisan makeup of Congress\u2014whether a majority of its members are from the president\u2019s party. The 1964 food stamp bill and the 1996 welfare bill will be used to illustrate the relationship between presidential success and Congress\u2019s partisan makeup.

We will also consider the normative question of how much power an unelected judiciary should have in a democratic system. The primary case study in this session will be the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Citizens United v.

This course teaches the basics of computer graphics that apply to all of these domains.  Students will learn to create computer-generated images of 3D scenes, including flybys of objects, make a real-time scene viewer, and create very realistic images with raytracing. We will start with a simple example of viewing a teapot from anywhere in space, understanding the basic mathematics of virtual camera placement. Next, you will learn how to use real-time graphics programming languages like OpenGL and GLSL to create your own scene viewer, enabling you to fly around and manipulate 3D scenes. Finally, we will teach you to create highly realistic images with reflections and shadows using raytracing.CSE167x teaches the foundations of computer graphics. This course runs for 6 weeks and consists of four segments. Each segment includes an individual programming assignment:This term, students who earn a total score of 50% or greater will have passed the course and may obtain a certificate from UC San DiegoX.FAQWhat is the format of the class?The class will consist of lecture videos, brief exercises, and homework assignments. Each of the four segments of the course will have 2-3 lectures. Each lecture includes 3-5 lecture videos, which last between 10 and 20 minutes. There will be a brief exercise after each lecture video to help you test your understanding of the material. Your score will be determined entirely by programming assignments for which you will receive immediate autograder feedback. You may submit your assignment to the autograder multiple times; only your last submission will count.Programming projects are to be implemented individually without copying code from other students, largely identical online resources, or previous instances of the class. However, short of posting or sharing actual explicit code, you are encouraged to collaborate and discuss problems in the discussion forums.Will the text of the lectures be available?Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.Do I need to watch the lectures live?No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. You can \"work ahead\" if you want to move faster than the due dates. Conversely, you can progress at a slower pace. Please note that certificates will only be awarded to students who obtain the requisite score by turning in assignments by the established deadlines.How much does it cost to take the course?Nothing: the course is free. If you expect to be doing a lot of graphics programming in the future, we would recommend the OpenGL and GLSL programming guides, but it is by no means required to purchase them. There are many free online resources for these topics, and we will be posting links to them.What computer system do I need for the course?The course material involves C++\/OpenGL\/GLSL programming that is portable. We provide skeleton code for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This is a modern course involving programmable shaders, but any machine built in the last few years should be adequate. We provide many compilation hints and tips, and Homework 0 is to ensure you can compile and work with the autograder. You do need some kind of C++ development environment; we provide several resources to get you started for Homework 0. In the highly unlikely event you cannot get your machine to work, you will hopefully have adequate time to find another system.Will I learn Maya\/DirectX\/3D Studio Max etc.?This is a course on the foundations of computer graphics and covers concepts, not the intricacies of a particular software package. That said, you will be able to write complex interactive and offline 3D graphics programs at the end of the course in C++, OpenGL and GLSL.Can I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants?Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster.I have a disability (visual\/hearing etc.) Can I take the course?In most cases, yes. We provide transcripts for all lectures. Many leading computer graphics researchers have had visual impairments like color-blindness. However, this being a computer graphics course that relies on visual image comparisons, we probably cannot provide adequate support for those who are legally blind.I have a busy schedule this fall. Can I still take the course?The course does require about 12 hours per week of work, and the assignments (where you are given two weeks) require the time. Certificates of achievement require a passing score. Of course, you are welcome to just go through the lectures or attempt some of the assignments if you are not interested in a certificate; we hope to provide something for everyone.\u00a0","course_syllabus":"not available","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/computer-graphics-2","text":"Computer Graphics This course is part of a Professional Certificate Today, computer graphics is a central part of our lives, in movies, games, computer-aided design, virtual simulators, visualization and even imaging products and cameras.

These kind of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures withinunlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images, sound, and text), which consitutes the vast majority of data in the world. TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement deep learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressional, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning. In this TensorFlow course, you will learn the basic concepts of TensorFlow, the main functions, operations and the execution pipeline. Starting with a simple \u201cHello Word\u201d example, throughout the course you will be able to see how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of error functions.

Think images, sound, and textual data. Learn how to apply Deep Learning with TensorFlow to this type of data to solve real-world problems. Traditional neural networks rely on shallow nets, composed of one input, one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layers, or so-called more depth. These kind of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures withinunlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images, sound, and text), which consitutes the vast majority of data in the world. TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement deep learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressional, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning. In this TensorFlow course, you will learn the basic concepts of TensorFlow, the main functions, operations and the execution pipeline. Starting with a simple \u201cHello Word\u201d example, throughout the course you will be able to see how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of error functions. This concept is then explored in the Deep Learning world. You will learn how to apply TensorFlow for backpropagation to tune the weights and biases while the Neural Networks are being trained.

We also need to improve working conditions for the 780 million women and men who are employed but not earning enough to lift themselves and their families out of poverty. In addressing these core issues we will not only see increasing decent work opportunities but also more robust, inclusive and poverty-reducing growth.This course explores the past and future of work in the context of the SDGs, particularly SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. It examines the state of income and employment around the world, barriers to employment, policies to promote economic opportunity, and the future of work in our rapidly changing world. Encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation are key to achieving the SDGs, as are effective measures to eradicate forced labour, slavery and human trafficking. With these targets in mind, the world can achieve full and productive employment and decent work, for all women and men, by 2030.This seven-module massive open online course (MOOC) provides an in-depth look at the issues of inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. The topics covered include structural shifts in economies and work; informality, gender and child labor, the modern welfare state; the future of work, and more. The course concludes with a special module by the ILO on realizing decent work for all and achieving SDG 8.This course is for:Policy professionals who want to understand frameworks for SDG planningDevelopment practitioners seeking knowledge on goals-based developmentAdvanced undergraduates and graduate students interested in economics, development, and other key concepts related to the SDGsModule 1: Decent Work for Sustainable DevelopmentModule 2: Transitions in Employment and WorkModule 3: Challenges of Work: Informality, Gender and Child LaborModule 4: Current Policy ResponsesModule 5: Structural and Institutional Models for the Future of WorkModule 6: Future of Jobs and WorkModule 7: Special Module in Partnership with the ILO: Achieving SDG 8 and Realizing Decent Work for All","course_syllabus":"The link between employment, work, income and wealthGlobal perspectives on changes to formal employmentThe challenges of child labor, gender disparity and informal employment Modern welfare state and novel policy instruments Structural and institutional models for the future of workArtificial Intelligence and the future of workWhat it takes to achieve SDG 8 and realize decent work for all, featured in a special module by the ILO.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/work-and-employment-for-a-sustainable-future","text":"Work and Employment for a Sustainable Future We are living in a financially fragile world.

We explore glasses and polymers, learn about the factors that influence their structure, and learn how materials scientists measure and describe the structure of these materials. Then we begin a discussion of the crystalline state, exploring what it means for a material to be crystalline, how we describe directions in a crystal, and how we can determine the structure of crystal through x-ray diffraction. We explore the underlying crystalline structures that underpin so many of the materials that surround us. Finally, we look at how tensors can be used to represent the properties of three-dimensional materials, and we consider how symmetry places constraints on the properties of materials. We move on to an exploration of quasi-, plastic, and liquid crystals. Then, we learn about the point defects that are present in all crystals, and we will learn how the presence of these defects lead to diffusion in materials. Next, we will explore dislocations in materials. We will introduce the descriptors that we use to describe dislocations, we will learn about dislocation motion, and will consider how dislocations dramatically affect the strength of materials.

It's learning to speak to the dead. At first the book just sits there silent as the grave, but if we listen carefully then, softly at first, the poetry begins to speak to us and we find ourselves speaking to it in response. Dante is the master of speaking with the dead. He convinces us that the dead can tell us things we do not know\u2014things we cannot discover about the meaning of life because we are still in the middle of it. He shows us that conversations with the dead can change the way that we look at life. You and I may not have enough imagination to explore the realms of death that open up in the middle of life, and Dante knows that no one can find their way through life without a guide. This course will help you discover the magic of Dante's poetry and Dante will teach you to imagine the deepest terrors and the highest hopes that are still undiscovered in your heart. Only then will you be in a position to decide finally, for yourself, who you choose to become. In this course, you will begin to question for yourself the meaning of human freedom, responsibility and identity by reading and responding to Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. The Comedy , which is richly steeped in the medieval culture of 14th century, still speaks vividly to modern readers struggling with the questions \u201cwho am I?\u201d and \u201cwhat meaning or value can my life have?\u201d Dante struggled with the same questions before coming to a moment of vision that wholly transformed him as a person. This course is presented to you through the MyDante platform, an online environment developed by Professor Frank Ambrosio in collaboration with the Georgetown University Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS). Throughout the course, you will be asked to reflect on Dante's interpretation of freedom, how it functions in the formation of personal identity, and whether we might be able to find appropriate metaphors to discuss these issues in our modern lives. You, the modern reader, will only understand the full implications of Dante's poetry if you participate with it in a way that is personal and genuinely contemplative. Through the MyDante platform, you will learn to know yourself in your own historical, personal, and spiritual contexts as you journey toward a richer understanding of your freedom, identity, and responsibility as a person.As a self-paced course, the primary goal is to giveyou the opportunity to explore Dante's poem as fully as their interest and time allows. A minimal expectation for an initial, basic comprehension of the material and successful completion of the self-assessment process would be approximately 75 hours forthis complete course.","course_syllabus":"Book1: Vita Nuova ","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/the-divine-comedy-dantes-journey-to-freedom","text":"The Divine Comedy: Dante's Journey to Freedom Jorge Luis Borges, the great Argentine writer, said that no one should deny themselves the pleasure of reading Dante's Divine Comedy.

We then move on to describing how raw data and experimental information are imported into R and how we use Bioconductor classes to organize these data, whether generated locally, or harvested from public repositories or institutional archives. Genomic features are generally identified using intervals in genomic coordinates, and highly efficient algorithms for computing with genomic intervals will be examined in detail. Statistical methods for testing gene-centric or pathway-centric hypotheses with genome-scale data are found in packages such as limma, some of these techniques will be illustrated in lectures and labs.Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.These courses make up two Professional Certificates and are self-paced:Data Analysis for Life Sciences:Genomics Data Analysis:This class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.HarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

We begin with an introduction to the relevant biology, explaining what we measure and why. Then we focus on the two main measurement technologies: next generation sequencing and microarrays. We then move on to describing how raw data and experimental information are imported into R and how we use Bioconductor classes to organize these data, whether generated locally, or harvested from public repositories or institutional archives. Genomic features are generally identified using intervals in genomic coordinates, and highly efficient algorithms for computing with genomic intervals will be examined in detail. Statistical methods for testing gene-centric or pathway-centric hypotheses with genome-scale data are found in packages such as limma, some of these techniques will be illustrated in lectures and labs.Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you.

Real-world approaches and tools are discussed for all three levers across varying staffing approaches, release and sprint processes for quality assurance, and the use of product-level tools for quality control.Week 3: The third week drives home the need to \u201cbegin with the end in mind\u201d by closing User Stories incrementally using a Definition of Done that links the three Ps together across each sprint cycle (planning, execution, and control).Week 4: The final fourth week addresses controlling Agile processes at scale, from sampling and building intuition across Agile team ceremonies, to managing team decisions and performance, and even portfolios of projects using simplified metrics.

Week 3: Opportunity framing\nThis week all necessary steps of the early project phases are elaborated: identifying the stakeholders involved, scoping of the project (high level) after formulating the project objectives and setting up the initial risk register. With your team, you will select a topic for your team's project execution plan (PEP). Week 4: The project assurance plan\nDo you select the appropriate contracting strategy after defining the project assurance plan or is it the other way around? We decided to first elaborate on the management processes to be followed in a project. How does a project assurance plan look like? Week 5: Selecting the contracting strategy\nIn selecting the appropriate contracting strategy, we should not only focus on the contract. This sounds contradictory, but it is an essential lesson to learn this week. We will introduce the contracting quilt and explain the importance of relational attitudes. Also we discuss the importance of senior management commitment. With your team, you will write the first outline of your project execution plan (PEP). Week 6: Time and cost estimates\nNow that a lot of the project preparation is done, it is time for some basic project management skills: the skills of scheduling and cost estimation. After thorough introduction of these skills, you will be asked to prepare a baseline schedule for your own project and, based on the baseline schedule, create a rough baseline cost estimate. Week 7: Bringing it together in the project execution plan\nAll ingredients of the project execution plan (PEP) have been discussed so far and are to be combined in the PEP that should be delivered at the end of this week.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/project-management-of-engineering-projects-prepari","text":"Project Management of Engineering Projects: Preparing for Success Create your own project plan and learn the importance of the early project phases in achieving project success.

It will explore the key drivers of ICT-enabled services in agriculture as well as the lessons learned so far. The module also introduces the Principles of Digital Development established in 2017 to capture the shifting role of technologies in global development. The second section of the module spotlights the impact of mobile phones and mobile technologies on agriculture and rural development.Week 2: ICT and Digital Tools for Enhancing Productivity on the FarmIn the modules, they are two sections; first section focuses on their impact on on-farm productivity; the second section focuses on improving farming practices through extension and advisory services.Section 1: How can farmers and governments use ICT and digital tools to increase agricultural productivity? At the local level, farmers can use ICT to match cropping practices to climatic trends, use inputs and resources environmentally and sustainably, and cope with productivity threats. At the national level, public officials can adjust policies to reflect the data collected with ICT and digital tools, predict food supplies, target social programs, or promote yield technologies.Section 2: ICT and digital tools have the potential to transform extension and advisory services in several ways\u2014including changing the way in which extension agents do their work, but also changing the ways extension institutions are organized and staffed. The emergence of public and private innovators and start-ups with business models built around ICT-enabled advisory services signals the types of transformations that are likely to come.Week 3: Empowering Smallholder Farmers through ICT\/Digital Tools in Financial ServicesNew channels for delivering financial services (facilitated by ICT), new players, and greater competition enable service providers to offer a larger suite of financial products and services and acquire better financial information, some of which is useful for government regulation and policy development. A number of non-bank institutions have developed innovative approaches to financing agriculture, enabled by or integrated with ICT, including mobile financial services, branchless banking, ATMs, and smartcards.While the digital revolution is reaching rural areas in many developing countries, the rural-urban digital divide remains, and rural women face a triple divide: digital, rural, and gender. This module looks at the benefits of ICT when placed in the hands of men and women working in agriculture and rural areas. It examines the challenges that must be overcome and provides recommendations for rural communities to take full and equal advantage of ICT.Week 4: Strengthening Agricultural Market Access with ICT and Digital ToolsFarmers use mobile phones to build a network of contacts and draw on this wider expertise to obtain critical information more rapidly. The mobile phone, its special applications, and the Internet are essentially becoming management tools for farmers, especially in relation to market intelligence. Greater access to information helps farmers make better decisions about transportation and logistics, price and location, supply and demand, diversification of their product base, and access to inputs.ICT also facilitates market research, increasingly using live information. This market information strengthens farmers\u2019 position in their day-to-day trading. Over time, market intelligence enables them to focus on satisfying consumers\u2019 and buyers\u2019 demands and on developing relationships with stakeholders in the next stage of the value chain. The key development challenge lies in assembling and disseminating this information in a timely manner, not just to traders or larger-scale farmers but also to smallholders.Week 5: Using ICT for Remote Sensing, Crowdsourcing, and Big DataThis module consists of three sections. (1) Remote sensing, (2) Crowdsourcing and crowd mapping, and (3) Big data for analytics:The first section , \u201cRemote Sensing for Sustainable Agriculture,\u201d focuses on the different types of geographical solutions that producers and others in agricultural value chains can use to increase efficiency, reduce waste, and ultimately bring about more sustainable agricultural practices.The second section on \u201cCrowdsourcing and Crowd mapping: The Power of Volunteers,\u201d focuses on how advances in social networking and data collection are enabling individuals to share hyperlocalized data in ways that have the potential to benefit society more broadly.The last section, \u201cBig Data for Analytics,\u201d focuses on how all of these agriculture-related data collected globally can be mined and analyzed in ways that lead to meaningful insights about how agriculture can be made more sustainable and productive.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/e-learning-on-digital-agriculture","text":"e-Learning on Digital Agriculture Agriculture is no exception to digital revolution, going beyond a simple adoption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).

Giller: ","course_syllabus":"Week 1: Introduction\nThis first week we are setting the scene for the global food situation today and projected demand and supply options tomorrow. Covering the four pillars of global food systems, we will zoom in on availability issues, and more in particular on crop production, as central theme of this course. Photosynthesis plays a key role in this process, turning solar light into food, which fuels mankind. Analogously to physical principles applied in building houses, you\u2019ll be acquainted to the bio-physical principles in growing crops. Week 2: Potential production\nPotential production is the simplest representation of crop growth, defined by the crop's genetic potential and the ambient growth factors radiation, temperature and carbon dioxide concentration in the air. Under perfect crop management, with no limitation of water and nutrients, and a weed, pathogen and pest free environment, crops reach their potential production. This week focuses on the conversion of carbon dioxide into plant biomass as powered by solar radiation, with temperature as modifying factor. Based on variation in solar radiation and temperature around the globe, you\u2019ll be able to calculate potential crop yields for different locations. Week 3: Water limited production\nIn the process of fixing carbon dioxide from the air into biomass, crops inevitably lose water by transpiration. When transpired water from the leaf surface is not adequately replenished through water uptake by the roots, crop production becomes water-limited, resulting in lower yields. Accounting for the evaporative demand of the air and water availability to the crop, water-limited production can be assessed. Conversely, to reach potential yield, you may determine the amount of water required through irrigation, as a yield increasing measure. Week 4: Nutrient limited production\nIn addition to water, nutrients are essential to crop production to support physiological processes, like photosynthesis. Various nutrients are absorbed from the soil by the roots. When nutrient availability falls short, production becomes nutrient-limited. In that situation nutrient application by manure or artificial fertilizers is a yield increasing measure.. Week 5: Actual production\nActual crop production refers a situation where production is further reduced by effects of weed, pests (insects, mites, nematodes, rodents, and birds), diseases (fungi, bacteria, viruses) and\/or pollutants. This introduces an extra level of complexity in plant production. In spite of intensive crop protection measures in some parts of the world, the actual production is the common production situation for the majority of the world's agricultural production systems. We will look at how weeds, and pests and diseases affect crop yields and what measures can be taken to prevent losses. Week 6: Synthesis\nHaving tackled the three distinguished production situations separately in the previous weeks, we now come back to complete the diagram reflecting the 'principles of production ecology'. Hopefully, it means more to you now and you can use it in analysing the impact of genetics, environment and management on crop yields, as will be discussed in this synopsis.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/sustainable-food-security-crop-production","text":"Sustainable Food Security: Crop Production Learn the basics of crop production and find out how to feed the future world population without depleting our planet\u2019s resources!

We start this module by looking in detail at the fundamental building blocks: arrays and linked lists. From there, we build up two important data structures: stacks and queues. Next, we look at trees: examples of how they\u2019re used in Computer Science, how they\u2019re implemented, and the various ways they can be traversed. Once you\u2019ve completed this module, you will be able to implement any of these data structures, as well as have a solid understanding of the costs of the operations, as well as the tradeoffs involved in using each data structure.Module 2: Dynamic Arrays and Amortized Analysis In this module, we discuss Dynamic Arrays: a way of using arrays when it is unknown ahead-of-time how many elements will be needed. Here, we also discuss amortized analysis: a method of determining the amortized cost of an operation over a sequence of operations. Amortized analysis is very often used to analyse performance of algorithms when the straightforward analysis produces unsatisfactory results, but amortized analysis helps to show that the algorithm is actually efficient. It is used both for Dynamic Arrays analysis and will also be used in the end of this course to analyze Splay trees.Module 3: Priority Queues and Disjoint Set Union We start this module by considering priority queues which are used to efficiently schedule jobs, either in the context of a computer operating system or in real life, to sort huge files, which is the most important building block for any Big Data processing algorithm, and to efficiently compute shortest paths in graphs, which is a topic we will cover in our next course. For this reason, priority queues have built-in implementations in many programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python. We will see that these implementations are based on a beautiful idea of storing a complete binary tree in an array that allows to implement all priority queue methods in just few lines of code. We will then switch to disjoint sets data structure that is used, for example, in dynamic graph connectivity and image processing. We will see again how simple and natural ideas lead to an implementation that is both easy to code and very efficient. By completing this module, you will be able to implement both these data structures efficiently from scratch.Modules 4 and 5: Hash Tables In this module you will learn about very powerful and widely used technique called hashing. Its applications include implementation of programming languages, file systems, pattern search, distributed key-value storage and many more. You will learn how to implement data structures to store and modify sets of objects and mappings from one type of objects to another one. You will see that naive implementations either consume huge amount of memory or are slow, and then you will learn to implement hash tables that use linear memory and work in O(1) on average!Module 6: Binary Search Trees In this module we study binary search trees, which are a data structure for doing searches on dynamically changing ordered sets. You will learn about many of the difficulties in accomplishing this task and the ways in which we can overcome them. In order to do this you will need to learn the basic structure of binary search trees, how to insert and delete without destroying this structure, and how to ensure that the tree remains balanced.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/data-structures-fundamentals","text":"Data Structures Fundamentals This course is part of a MicroMasters\u00ae Program A good algorithm usually comes together with a set of good data structures that allow the algorithm to manipulate the data efficiently.

In the European Union, construction alone accounts for approximately 30% of the raw material input. In addition, the different life-cycle stages of buildings, from construction to end-of-life, cause a significant environmental impact related to energy consumption, waste generation and direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. The Circular Economy model offers guidelines and principles for promoting more sustainable building construction and reducing the impact on our environment. If you are interested in taking your first steps in transitioning to a more sustainable manner of construction, then this course is for you! In this course you will become familiar with circularity as a systemic, multi-disciplinary approach, concerned with the different scale, from material to product, building, city, and region. Some aspects of circularity that will be included in this course are maximizing reuse and recycle levels by closing the material loops.

Building construction is one of the most waste producing sectors. In the European Union, construction alone accounts for approximately 30% of the raw material input. In addition, the different life-cycle stages of buildings, from construction to end-of-life, cause a significant environmental impact related to energy consumption, waste generation and direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. The Circular Economy model offers guidelines and principles for promoting more sustainable building construction and reducing the impact on our environment. If you are interested in taking your first steps in transitioning to a more sustainable manner of construction, then this course is for you! In this course you will become familiar with circularity as a systemic, multi-disciplinary approach, concerned with the different scale, from material to product, building, city, and region. Some aspects of circularity that will be included in this course are maximizing reuse and recycle levels by closing the material loops. You will also learn how the Circular Economy can help to realign business incentives in supply chains, and how consumers can be engaged and contribute to the transition through new business models enabling circular design, reuse, repair, remanufacturing and recycling of building components.

The course covers IT disciplines including systems and services, network and security, scripting and programming, data management, and the business of IT. The course also surveys technologies within these disciplines. Information technology (IT) can be viewed as a system, a combination of independent parts all working together to accomplish a certain goal. Systems are everywhere. For example, the respiratory, circulatory, nervous, and other subsystems of the body work together towards the common goal of keeping humans alive. IT is similar in that it consists of various subsystems all working towards a common goal. Information Technology Foundations will examine how the system called IT helps an organization advance its business goals and vision, resulting in improved growth, profits, and productivity. The course will explore the different components of IT and how they work together as a system to support the different aspects of an organization.

Finally, we see the pumping lemma for regular languages -- a way of proving that certain languages are not regular languages.Our second topic is context-free grammars and their languages. We learn about parse trees and follow a pattern similar to that for finite automata: closure properties, decision properties, and a pumping lemma for context-free languages. We also introduce the pushdown automaton, whose nondeterministic version is equivalent in language-defining power to context-free grammars.Next, we introduce the Turing machine, a kind of automaton that can define all the languages that can reasonably be said to be definable by any sort of computing device (the so-called \"recursively enumerable languages\"). We shall learn how \"problems\" (mathematical questions) can be expressed as languages. That lets us define problems to be \"decidable\" if their language can be defined by a Turing machine and \"undecidable\" if not. We shall see some basic undecidable problems, for example, it is undecidable whether the intersection of two context-free languages is empty.Last, we look at the theory of intractable problems. These are problems that, while they are decidable, have almost certainly no algorithm that runs in time less than some exponential function of the size of their input. We meet the NP-complete problems, a large class of intractable problems. This class includes many of the hard combinatorial problems that have been assumed for decades or even centuries to require exponential time, and we learn that either none or all of these problems have polynomial-time algorithms.

The programming challenges represent an important (and often the most difficult!) part of this specialization because the only way to fully understand an algorithm is to implement it. Writing correct and efficient programs is hard; please don\u2019t be surprised if they don\u2019t work as you planned\u2014our first programs did not work either! We will help you on your journey through the specialization by showing how to implement your first programming challenges. We will also introduce testing techniques that will help increase your chances of passing assignments on your first attempt. In case your program does not work as intended, we will show how to fix it, even if you don\u2019t yet know which test your implementation is failing on.Module 2: Introduction\nIn this module you will learn that programs based on efficient algorithms can solve the same problem billions of times faster than programs based on na\u00efve algorithms. You will learn how to estimate the running time and memory of an algorithm without even implementing it. Armed with this knowledge, you will be able to compare various algorithms, select the most efficient ones, and finally implement them as our programming challenges!Module 3: Greedy Algorithms\nIn this module you will learn about seemingly na\u00efve yet powerful class of algorithms called greedy algorithms. After you will learn the key idea behind the greedy algorithms, you may feel that they represent the algorithmic Swiss army knife that can be applied to solve nearly all programming challenges in this course. But be warned: with a few exceptions that we will cover, this intuitive idea rarely works in practice! For this reason, it is important to prove that a greedy algorithm always produces an optimal solution before using this algorithm. In the end of this module, we will test your intuition and taste for greedy algorithms by offering several programming challenges.Module 4: Divide-and-Conquer\nIn this module you will learn about a powerful algorithmic technique called Divide and Conquer. Based on this technique, you will see how to search huge databases millions of times faster than using na\u00efve linear search. You will even learn that the standard way to multiply numbers (that you learned in the grade school) is far from the being the fastest! We will then apply the divide-and-conquer technique to design two efficient algorithms (merge sort and quick sort) for sorting huge lists, a problem that finds many applications in practice. Finally, we will show that these two algorithms are optimal, that is, no algorithm can sort faster!Modules 5 and 6: Dynamic Programming\nIn this final module of the course you will learn about the powerful algorithmic technique for solving many optimization problems called Dynamic Programming. It turned out that dynamic programming can solve many problems that evade all attempts to solve them using greedy or divide-and-conquer strategy. There are countless applications of dynamic programming in practice: from maximizing the advertisement revenue of a TV station, to search for similar Internet pages, to gene finding (the problem where biologists need to find the minimum number of mutations to transform one gene into another). You will learn how the same idea helps to automatically make spelling corrections and to show the differences between two versions of the same text.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/algorithmic-design-and-techniques","text":"Algorithmic Design and Techniques This course is part of a MicroMasters\u00ae Program In this course, part of the Algorithms and Data Structures MicroMasters program, you will learn basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems, which arise in practical applications such as sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms and dynamic programming.This course will cover theories, including:You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second). https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/algorithmic-design-and-techniques"},{"title":"Drinking Water Treatment","summary":"Learn about urban water services, focusing on conventional technologies for drinking water treatment.","n_enrolled":"51,918","course_type":"Self-paced on your time","institution":"Delft University of Technology","instructors":"Luuk Rietveld-Doris van Halem","Level":"Intermediate","subject":"Engineering","language":"English","subtitles":"English","course_effort":"6\u20138 hours per week","course_length":"7 Weeks","price":"FREE-Add a Verified Certificate for $50 USD","course_description":"This course focuses on conventional technologies for drinking water treatment.

Lecture 2: DNA Organization We explore how DNA is arranged, packaged, and organized within the cell. We examine chromatin architecture, how chromatin is modified by histones, and how epigenetics can affect gene expression. Lecture 3: DNA Replication I We explore the mechanisms by which DNA is copied and the complications that arise due to the asymmetric construction of DNA with respect to its 3' and 5' ends. We examine the dynamic nature of the replication proteins and the exquisite specificity with which these proteinscan catalyze essential biochemical reactions, and how enzymatic activity can be regulated within the larger context of the cell. Lecture 4: DNA Replication II We explore further the replication machinerythat allows for the coordination of leading and lagging strand synthesis during DNA replication, a feature of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA replication. We examine the initiation of DNA replication at origins of replication. We also discuss the involvement of nucleosomes and histones in this process, which is a unique feature of eukaryotic DNA. We also examinetermination of DNA replication and the involvement of telomerase in solving a unique problem of eukaryoticDNA replication: shortening of chromosomal endsduring DNA replication. Lecture 5: DNA Manipulation We examine the manipulation of DNA. The cell can restore (or sometimes alter) DNA by repairing damage from a variety of environmental sources. Repair of double-stranded breaks includes recombination (or exchanging DNA sequences between two different dsDNAs). We examine methods of DNA amplification, analysis, \"cloning,\" and sequencing. These forms of \"manipulating\" DNA employ enzymes and functional properties that we have discussed. Our ever-more-efficient and cost-effective ability to sequence and to recombine DNA fragments has transformed biological and biomedical sciences, and much remains to be discovered!","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/dna-biologys-genetic-code","text":"DNA: Biology\u2019s Genetic Code DNA carries the defining data for life in a simple genetic code that comes with its own \u201cback-up\u201d system. Explore DNA structure with us! DNA encodes our genetic information and is passed on within cells to maintain living organisms and to produce the next generation. The recognition of DNA as the genetic material and the ensuing identification of its structure and coding mechanism were both revolutionary and foundational. These discoveries led to transformational integration across the biological sciences with a common understanding of this fundamental unit of life! Join this exploration of DNA structure, packaging, replication, and manipulation.The course utilizes video lectures, research articles, case studies, and molecular models to convey information. The course grade will be based on questions with each video lecture, quizzes, homework, and a final exam. https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/dna-biologys-genetic-code"},{"title":"Music For Wellness","summary":"Learn how music can help reduce stress and improve your health, and well-being.","n_enrolled":"19,728","course_type":"Self-paced on your time","institution":"Berklee College of Music","instructors":"Suzanne Hanser-Annette Philip","Level":"Introductory","subject":"Humanities","language":"English","subtitles":"English","course_effort":"3\u20135 hours per week","course_length":"4 Weeks","price":"FREE-Add a Verified Certificate for $49 USD","course_description":"You love music.

We provide an overview of the ten-step process in market segmentation analysis. In Step 1, we explain the requirements for market segmentation, helping learners decide whether their organisation is ready to segment. In Step 2 we specify the ideal target segment, including segment evaluation criteria. Module 2: Steps 3 and 4\nIn Step 3,we describe collecting data and define the segmentation variables and criteria, and discuss different sources of data. In Step 4 we explore the data and discuss data cleaning and how to pre-process categorical and numeric variables. We also demonstrate how to use R, to assist you with exploring the data. Module 3: Step 5\nIn Step 5,we extract market segments and group consumers using distance-based, hierarchical, and partitioning methods; hybrid approaches; and model-based methods. We also explain data structure analysis. Module 4: Steps 6 and 7\nIn Steps 6 and 7, we profile and describe segments. We use traditional approaches as well as visualisation techniques to identify key characteristics of market segments. In Step 7 we develop and visualise a complete picture of market segments; this includes testing and predicting segment differences in descriptor variables. Module 5: Steps 8, 9 and 10\nIn Step 8, we select the target segments including the tasks targeting decision and market segment evaluation. In Step 9 we customise the marketing mix. We also discuss the implications of market segmentation for marketing mix decisions concerning product, price, place,and promotion. Finally, in Step 10, we evaluate the success of the segmentation strategy, and stability of segment membership. We conclude with a discussion of segment hopping and segment evolution.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/market-segmentation-analysis","text":"Market Segmentation Analysis Learn the ten-step process to data-driven market segmentation analysis - developing skills that will enable you to meet customers' needs and gain competitive advantage.

Identifica como as decis\u00f5es fundamentadas ajudam a lidar com as mudan\u00e7as. A tomada de decis\u00f5es no mundo de hoje, um mundo em crescente complexidade, com amplas mudan\u00e7as e incertezas, cria a necessidade de abordagens que permitam discernir os problemas reais e as causas que os originam. Identificar quais s\u00e3o esses problemas, na maioria dos casos, exige desafiar as suposi\u00e7\u00f5es nas quais baseamos nossos julgamentos, em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao mundo e suas realidades. Poder\u00edamos definir o pensamento cr\u00edtico como \"aquele modo de pensar - sobre qualquer assunto, conte\u00fado ou problema - em que o pensador melhora a qualidade de seu pensamento apreendendo as estruturas inerentes ao ato de pensar e sujeitando-as a padr\u00f5es intelectuais\".

In addition, we offer a \"Nukes in the News\" section to add topicality. The more you participate, the more you will get out of your experience.Our course differs from most online courses in a fundamental way: our goal is not just to provide facts, but to inspire you to take action. You have the power to make a difference, and I believe this course will give you knowledge and hopefully motivation to do so. You can read more about the subject, and find ways to become involved, by visiting the website of the William J. Perry Project: www.wjperryproject.org.Course InstructorsDr. William J.

Most recently, she co-authored a book with Gary LaFree titled, Countering Terrorism.Dr. Lynn Eden is a Senior Research Scholar Emerita. She was a Senior Research Scholar at Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation until January 2016, as well as the Associate Director for Research. Dr. Eden's book, Whole World on Fire: Organizations, Knowledge, and Nuclear Weapons Devastation, explores how and why the U.S. government--from World War II to the present--has greatly underestimated the damage caused by nuclear weapons by failing to predict damage from firestorms. Whole World on Fire won the American Sociological Association's 2004 Robert K. Merton Award for the Best Book in Science, Knowledge, and Technology.Dr. Stephen Flynn is Founding Director of the Global Resilience Institute at Northeastern University (https:\/\/globalresilience.northeastern.edu\/) where he leads a university-wide research enterprise to inform and advance societal resilience.

He is also a Research Scholar at the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy (CISSM).Dr. Joseph Martz is a physicist and 35-year employee of Los Alamos National Laboratory, who has focused on issues surrounding nuclear security, nuclear weapons, and stockpile stewardship. His early work led to a nationwide evaluation and repackaging of stored nuclear materials, and he was a co-developer of the ARIES system, a means to dismantle and safely recover plutonium from excess nuclear weapons. In addition to his research at Los Alamos, Dr. Martz has led national project teams, including the recent reliable-replacement warhead design competition and several complex nuclear material experiments.Ellen O\u2019Kane Tauscher represented California\u2019s 10th Congressional District in the East Bay of San Francisco for seven terms from 1997-2009. She served on the House Armed Services Committee and was Chair of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, overseeing the nuclear weapons stockpile and complex, among other forces, from 2006-2009. In 2009, Tauscher was nominated by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the United States Senate as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs. As Under Secretary of State, Tauscher was responsible for successfully closing negotiations of the New Start Treaty with the Russian Federation in March 2010 in Geneva and representing the United States at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference at the United Nations in May 2010.Dr. Alex Wellerstein is an Assistant Professor of Science and Technology Studies (STS) in the College of Arts and Letters at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey.

Developments at both the regional and global levels have emerged to challenge world peace and order. This course reviews the driving forces of International Politics. It first describes the post-World War II international order before moving on to look at its breakdown and resultant transformation. The course explores thorny issues in contemporary World Politics, including disorders in the Balkansthat resulted from the collapse of Yugoslavia; the rise of China and the return of Russia as major actors on the world stage; and the humanitariancrises in Bosnia and Kosovo where the West intervened, as well as Rwanda and others, where it did not. We'll then conduct an analysis of the Arab Spring, where democratic aspirations mainly failed and the resulting dislocations fanned the expansion of radical Islam and the associated wave of global terrorism. The course will also examine frozen conflicts such as the Arab-Israeli conflict, and conclude by looking at the problems of the global commons; such as climate change, pollution, pandemics, and growing refugeechallenges.","course_syllabus":"not available","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/contemporary-issues-in-world-politics","text":"Contemporary Issues in World Politics Explore major issues in world politics and learn how recent developments have challenged world order and peace.

It first describes the post-World War II international order before moving on to look at its breakdown and resultant transformation. The course explores thorny issues in contemporary World Politics, including disorders in the Balkansthat resulted from the collapse of Yugoslavia; the rise of China and the return of Russia as major actors on the world stage; and the humanitariancrises in Bosnia and Kosovo where the West intervened, as well as Rwanda and others, where it did not. We'll then conduct an analysis of the Arab Spring, where democratic aspirations mainly failed and the resulting dislocations fanned the expansion of radical Islam and the associated wave of global terrorism. The course will also examine frozen conflicts such as the Arab-Israeli conflict, and conclude by looking at the problems of the global commons; such as climate change, pollution, pandemics, and growing refugeechallenges. https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/contemporary-issues-in-world-politics"},{"title":"More Fun with Prime Numbers","summary":"Take a deep dive intoPrime Numbers - one of the most mysterious and important subjects in mathematics!","n_enrolled":"10,604","course_type":"Self-paced on your time","institution":"Kyoto University","instructors":"Tetsushi Ito","Level":"Intermediate","subject":"Math","language":"English","subtitles":"English","course_effort":"1\u20132 hours per week","course_length":"5 Weeks","price":"FREE-Add a Verified Certificate for $49 USD","course_description":"2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 are all prime numbers and they hold special significance.

It includes updated content, better audit and verified learner experiences, and bonus videos on key topics.The follow-on to this course series on \u201cAdvanced Scrum\u201d is expected by the end of Summer 2020. Speed is by far the most sought-after benefit of Agile. First mover advantages, the economic cost of delays, and the enabling effect on innovation drive the search for speed. Agile offers the fastest means of attaining speed: managing scope. But beyond the hype over scope management, there are key principles of non-traditional task management that ensure the scope chosen is delivered as efficiently as possible.In this course, you'll learn how to drive speed into any project by selecting and limiting work-in-progress through agile planning and task management. There are two principle roles involved, the scrum master and the product owner. However, the entire scrum team needs to understand the principles behind backlog refinement, sprint planning, and execution throughout the sprint cycle.In this course we'll show you how to run effective sprint planning meetings that produce a sprint backlog ready to deliver on your sprint goals and release objectives. You'll learn the power of prioritizing backlog items, and why we agile planning and sprint planning isn't just a managed list you work top-down in priority order. Instead, scrum teams commit to achieving goals and work together to ensure the user stories that are highest priority get delivered in this sprint, so the upcoming sprint isn't delayed. This also means understanding your team capacity and how to ensure safe and on-time delivery of the highest items on the product backlog that actually matter to your customer.While this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how sprint planning enables hyper productivity in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope takes you to the next course in the series on \u201cAgile Innovation and Problem Solving Skills.\u201dUpon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI). PDU credits are essential to those looking to maintain certification as a Project Management Professional (PMP).","course_syllabus":"Week 1: The first week focuses the discussion on Agile to its primary benefit, Speed, and how to easily calculate and prove its supremacy in benefits of any project management method because of timing impacts and market changes outside a project manager\u2019s control. Week 2: The second week explores why and how varying scope is the most powerful method to achieve speed; introducing the Exponential Pareto Principle and how to apply it effectively. Perhaps the most important lesson is that not all product backlog items are equal, and in fact, most don't matter at all! Week 3: The third week dives into second tier methods for achieving speed through sizing, simplicity, and sprints with real-world examples ranging from air and space craft to software. Team members work together to ensure a smooth glide on the burndown chart by actively managing work in process during daily scrum sessions. Week 4: The last week teaches ground-level techniques to avoid delays, increase speed, and apply a full range of planning, execution, and control techniques that will guarantee 2x or better improvement on traditional projects. This week is essential to producing a winning product backlog and release plan.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/driving-speed-through-agile-planning-2","text":"Sprint Planning for Faster Agile Team Delivery Drive speed into any project with prioritized backlogs, limiting work-in-process, and engaging the entire agile team in effective sprint planning. Version 2 of this course series delivers beyond the original agile certification. It includes updated content, better audit and verified learner experiences, and bonus videos on key topics.The follow-on to this course series on \u201cAdvanced Scrum\u201d is expected by the end of Summer 2020. Speed is by far the most sought-after benefit of Agile. First mover advantages, the economic cost of delays, and the enabling effect on innovation drive the search for speed. Agile offers the fastest means of attaining speed: managing scope. But beyond the hype over scope management, there are key principles of non-traditional task management that ensure the scope chosen is delivered as efficiently as possible.In this course, you'll learn how to drive speed into any project by selecting and limiting work-in-progress through agile planning and task management. There are two principle roles involved, the scrum master and the product owner. However, the entire scrum team needs to understand the principles behind backlog refinement, sprint planning, and execution throughout the sprint cycle.In this course we'll show you how to run effective sprint planning meetings that produce a sprint backlog ready to deliver on your sprint goals and release objectives. You'll learn the power of prioritizing backlog items, and why we agile planning and sprint planning isn't just a managed list you work top-down in priority order. Instead, scrum teams commit to achieving goals and work together to ensure the user stories that are highest priority get delivered in this sprint, so the upcoming sprint isn't delayed. This also means understanding your team capacity and how to ensure safe and on-time delivery of the highest items on the product backlog that actually matter to your customer.While this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how sprint planning enables hyper productivity in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope takes you to the next course in the series on \u201cAgile Innovation and Problem Solving Skills.\u201dUpon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI). PDU credits are essential to those looking to maintain certification as a Project Management Professional (PMP). https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/driving-speed-through-agile-planning-2"},{"title":"Introduction to Water and Climate","summary":"This course is part of a XSeries Program","n_enrolled":"36,320","course_type":"Self-paced on your time","institution":"Delft University of Technology","instructors":"Caroline Katsman-Herman Russchenberg-Hubert Savenije-Marcel Stive","Level":"Intermediate","subject":"Engineering","language":"English","subtitles":"English","course_effort":"6\u20138 hours per week","course_length":"10 Weeks","price":"FREE-Add a Verified Certificate for $50 USD","course_description":"Water is essential for life on Earth and of crucial importance for society.

The Tibetan aspect of this course surveys the Tibetan and Central Asian reception and development of these Indian Buddhist traditions that occurred in two distinct historical periods: (1) from 650 CE until ca. 850 CE, and (2) from ca. 950 CE to the present.   During the first period, the Indians' and Tibetans' massive efforts to translate into the Tibetan language the Sanskrit and Prakrit contents of the great Indian monastic university libraries resulted in the reception and preservation in Tibetan of the most essential parts of what was destroyed in India during the Persian, Turkish, and Tajik invasions and occupations in the early second millennium CE. These translations also enabled that Indian style of Buddhism to spread into the Mongolias and the Manchu empire in China.

The course begins with a survey of the origins of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent in the mid-first millennium BCE, as well as its transformation in the first millennium CE into the Sanskrit-language-based Mahayana Buddhism(s) that permeated the monastic traditions and flourished in India until around 1100 CE, and that persists up topresent dayin East Asia, Central Asia, and Vietnam.  The Tibetan aspect of this course surveys the Tibetan and Central Asian reception and development of these Indian Buddhist traditions that occurred in two distinct historical periods: (1) from 650 CE until ca. 850 CE, and (2) from ca. 950 CE to the present.   During the first period, the Indians' and Tibetans' massive efforts to translate into the Tibetan language the Sanskrit and Prakrit contents of the great Indian monastic university libraries resulted in the reception and preservation in Tibetan of the most essential parts of what was destroyed in India during the Persian, Turkish, and Tajik invasions and occupations in the early second millennium CE. These translations also enabled that Indian style of Buddhism to spread into the Mongolias and the Manchu empire in China. In addition to addressing such reception and preservation, wewill alsosurvey the unique ways in which these Indian forms of Buddhism were further developed in the Tibetan and Central Asian cultural spheres (throughout their histories, and especially in the second period that began after the destruction of Indian Buddhism).

Drawing from a variety of perspectives \u2013 cultural studies, economics, education, law, linguistics, psychology, public health, politics, social policy, and sociology - we begin by questioning meanings of gender in different cultural settings and historical moments. What do the representations of our currently used categories such as man, woman, transgender, queer, cisgender, bisexual, or intersex mean in different contexts? How are conversations about gender taking place in Asia and how do they converge or diverge from those happening elsewhere? The course is a comparative, interdisciplinary and cross-sector conversation which encourages reflective thinking about practices of gender. It courts and questions the fixity of language, traditions, laws, and practices as well as the resilience of stereotypes, biases, and structures which perpetuate myths, hierarchies and discrimination. Unraveling the interlinkages between these conversations and categories equips you with the skills needed to identify, recognize and reject outmoded or biased constructions of gender as well as the power hierarchies these embed within social relations. We will examine why gender equity is so important and yet hard to achieve. We scrutinize social and legal constructions of gender which continue to operate as though gender is binary and explore a more inclusive approach which reflects the gender continuum within the context of entrenched power structures. Through understanding gender and its relations with society, we look for solutions to eradicate gender discrimination and gender-based violence. Additionally, as digital technology plays an ever-increasing role in contemporary construction of social realities of people, the course looks into how, if at all, these networked communities offer new expressions of gender as performativity and the ways in which these replicate, reproduce or refashion traditional gender categories and roles.

The course examines manifestations and causes of gender inequality and its inextricable link to structural and institutional forces of discrimination. To better understand the interaction between identity and power, we look at gender-based violence. The #metoo movement has exposed not only the depth and scale of violence but also unmasked the asymmetries of power. Power and privilege are enjoyed by a select group while the voices of others remain invisible and ignored.

In this class, we will use interrupts to design a range of real-time systems including an audio player, a data acquisition system, a control system, and an interactive game. This is a hands-on, learn-by-doing course that shows you how to build solutions to real-world problems using embedded systems. These courses use a bottom-up approach to problem solving, building gradually from simple interfacing of switches and LEDs to complex concepts like display drivers, digital to analog conversion, generation of sound, analog to digital conversion, motor control, graphics, interrupts, and communication. We will present both general principles and practical tips for building circuits and programming the microcontroller in the C programming language. You will develop debugging skills using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and software instrumentation. Laboratory assignments are first performed in simulation, and then you will build and debug your system on the real microcontroller. At the conclusion of this course you will possess the knowledge to build your own arcade-style game from the ground up.This is the fourth time we have offered this course. Since the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive we do not plan major changes over the previous offerings of the course. We did however break the large class into two smaller classes. There are eight labs in part 1 and six labs in this class. Students can pick and choose a subset of labs to achieve certification. The three labs that students found most rewarding were the hand-held video game, generating sound using a digital to analog convertor, and creating a smart object using Wifi communication.To complete this course, you will be required to purchase a Texas Instruments TM4C123 microcontroller kit and a few electronic components. This microcontroller has a state-of-the-art ARM Cortex-M4 processor.We will provide instructions about purchasing the kit and installing required software at: http:\/\/edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com\/UT601x\/index.html.","course_syllabus":"The best way to understand what you will learn in this class is to list the labs you will complete and the example projects we will build. You will complete each lab first in simulation and then on the real board. For each module we will design a system and you will build and test a similar system.Module 1: Welcome and introduction to course and staffModule 11: UART - The Serial Interface, I\/O SynchronizationLab 11. Write C functions that output decimal and fixed-point numbers to serial portModule 12: InterruptsLab 12. Design and test a guitar tuner, producing a 440 Hz toneModule 13: DAC and SoundLab 13. Design and test a digital piano, with 4 inputs, digital to analog conversion, and soundModule 14: ADC and Data AcquisitionLab 14. Design and test a position measurement, with analog to digital conversion and calibrated outputModule 15: Systems Approach to Game DesignLab 15. Design and test a hand-held video game, which integrates all components from previous labs. Lab 15 will be graded by having students watch videos of each other's\u2019 games.Module 16: Wireless Communication and the Internet of ThingsLab 16. Connect a CC3100 booster pack to the LaunchPad and communicate with an access point. Lab 16 will first fetch weather from the internet, and then you will send data to the class server.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/embedded-systems-shape-the-world-multi-threaded-in","text":"Embedded Systems - Shape The World: Multi-Threaded Interfacing not available Learn how electronic gadgets are designed, developed, and built as embedded systems that shape the world.This is part two of a two part sequence. In this class, we will use interrupts to design a range of real-time systems including an audio player, a data acquisition system, a control system, and an interactive game. This is a hands-on, learn-by-doing course that shows you how to build solutions to real-world problems using embedded systems. These courses use a bottom-up approach to problem solving, building gradually from simple interfacing of switches and LEDs to complex concepts like display drivers, digital to analog conversion, generation of sound, analog to digital conversion, motor control, graphics, interrupts, and communication.

Let\u2019s explore how it reached you\u2026 Perhaps you know the films of martial arts icons Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan or the heroic bloodshed films of John Woo.Perhaps you are a fan of stars such as Maggie Cheung or Chow Yun Fat. Maybe you admire works by directors such as Wong Kar Wai.Whatever you know and wherever you are we invite you to join us on a journey to consider how the local and the global intersect to make Hong Kong cinema an integral part of popular culture around the world as well as a leading force in the development of world cinematic art.In this course you\u2019ll learn how flows of capital, people, technologies, ideas and creativity circulate and shape the cultural industry of filmmaking, resulting in transnational co-productions and cross-cultural co-operations. You\u2019ll see how these dynamic processes are inflected in characterization, plot development, and space-time configurations on Hong Kong screens.Our location in the cultural crossroads of Hong Kong allows us to introduce you to film professionals such as director Mabel Cheung and Andrew Lau, producer John Sham, film festival director Roger Garcia, and other guests, talking candidly about the industry.During your weeks with us you\u2019ll see demonstrations of martial arts choreography, participate in close analysis of film techniques, investigate Hong Kong global stardom, uncover the reasons for the worldwide appeal of genres such as the kung fu film, and nurture a comparative and critical understanding of issues of gender, race, migration. Best of all you\u2019ll partner with leading researchers in the field to appreciate Hong Kong\u2019s contribution to world cinema.Please watch these films so that you can get the most out of the course content. Please note that you will need to acquire and watch the films on your own. We advise you see the films before each week\u2019s material.Here is the list of films for each week.Week 1 \u2013 any Jackie Chan film (optional)Week 2 \u2013 any Bruce Lee film (optional), but we suggest Fist of Fury \/ The Chinese Connection (dir.

This transformation is not about small adjustments but a complete redesign of the retailer\u2019s business model.In this course, part of the Retail Management Professional Certificate program, you will learn from retailers that are successfully navigating this transformation. You will explore how to attract omnichannel customers, what fulfillment options these customers expect, how retailers can leverage their online and brick and mortar presence, and what retailers need to support an omnichannel strategy. By the end of the course, you won\u2019t be thinking about separated retail channels but one integrated retailer that is aligned to best serve today customer\u2019s needs.We have designed this course based on our own work in omnichannel retail. The course will suit a variety of participants from retail owners and undergraduate business majors, to retail specialists. https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/omnichannel-strategy-and-management"},{"title":"General Overview of Cannabis and the Industry\u2019s Outlook and Professions","summary":"An in-depth view of cannabis and its potential uses.","n_enrolled":"5,048","course_type":"Self-paced on your time","institution":"Doane University","instructors":"Jazmin Oliver-Amanda McKinney, MD, FACLM-Andrea Holmes, PhD","Level":"Introductory","subject":"Environmental Studies","language":"English","subtitles":"English","course_effort":"5\u201310 hours per week","course_length":"4 Weeks","price":"FREE-Add a Verified Certificate for $199 USD","course_description":"This course will provide a comprehensive overview of cannabis and its applications and uses.

Blockchain and its Governance\nThis module will expand off the Introduction to FinTech course (https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/introduction-to-fintech), to consider the most relevant and ethical ways such technology should be implemented, in a number of different industries or product segmentation. In particular, data collection, customer privacy, and transactional issues will be covered in this module. Cybersecurity & Crimes \nFinTech can make it easier and cheaper for banks to monitor and control financial transactions, thus reducing fraud and reducing bank costs. But at the same time, these tools can be used to steal money and other corporate secrets, hide illegality (including purchases of weapons, drugs, etc.), and finance terrorists and other criminal organizations. Accordingly, this module will consider the implications of such important issues. AI & FinTech \nIn this module we will consider the implications of building our own concepts of \u201chuman\u201d morality into amoral machines, as well as a consideration of whether human biases and prejudices can or will be built into such mechanisms, whether purposefully or unintentionally. Institutionalization vs. Decentralization \nOne of the key reasons people are calling for FinTech is for its decentralized nature, thus democratizing finance, and allowing regular people to participate more fully and affordably in financial transactions through technologies like cryptocurrencies, non-government issued IDs, and P2P lending. In this module we will address some large questions, considering whether FinTech should lead to a decentralized, democratized system of finance. Or whether existing institutions will adopt FinTech strategies to cement their existing hold on the financial markets. Big Questions Relating to the Introduction of FinTech \nIn this final module, we will consider some of the many outstanding questions and purposes of introducing FinTech to the world, exploring the many ways that FinTech can both help and hurt society. We will discuss financial inclusion, sustainable development, and many other positive aspects of FinTech development. Conversely, we will also consider how these same technologies and solutions could potentially be used to inhibit access to financial markets, or worse.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/fintech-ethics-and-risks","text":"FinTech Ethics and Risks Learn how individuals and organizations can utilize and regulate blockchain, AI, and other FinTech solutions to ensure their adoption does not come at the expense of societal growth.

This means that the flow speed is more than five times the speed of sound.

When a rocket launches a satellite into earth orbit, when a probe enters the atmosphere of another planet or when an aircraft is propelled by a supersonic combustion ramjet engine (a scramjet), hypersonic flows are encountered.

What is Hypersonics?\nThis section provides an introduction to the course. What we mean by \"hypersonic speeds\" is discussed and examples of vehicles that travel at such speeds are given. Shock waves and scramjets are also introduced. The rocket equation is introduced to show why staging of launch vehicles is used. The scramjet engine arrangement used throughout the course is outlined. Section 2. Isentropic Flow\nThe times when a flow can be considered to be \"isentropic\" are introduced. This leads on to the fundamentals of compressible flow and steady adiabatic flows. We use the flow in a scramjet nozzle to demonstrate the principles. Section 3. Shock Waves\nNormal and oblique shock waves form when objects travel at close to, or in excess of, the speed of sound. In this section, methods for modelling the flow across shock waves are presented and discussed. Results from experiments are used to show the influence of flow deflection angle on the shock wave formed at hypersonic speeds. We use the flow in a scramjet intake to demonstrate the principles. Section 4. Combustors in Scramjets\nFlows with friction, heat addition and stoichiometry are important considerations for scramjet combustors. In this section example problems are worked through to show the importance of friction and heat addition to fluid flow at different Mach numbers. Stoichiometric concepts are developed so that the use of different fuels can be modelled. Section 5. Hypersonics\nThis section looks at hypersonic flight, flight corridors and vehicle design. Hypersonics facilities, such as reflected shock tunnels and expansion tubes, are described since these are used to test scientific hypotheses related to hypersonic flight. Section 6. Scramjets\nThis section describes the state of scramjet technology as it exists today, examines the history of scramjets and then looks at future possibilities of scramjet technology. The overall thrust of an air breathing engine is calculated. Section 7. Project\nIn the final section, students are required to analyse the flow through an engine and determine the Specific Impulse for their own scramjet design.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/hypersonics-from-shock-waves-to-scramjets-2","text":"Hypersonics \u2013 from Shock Waves to Scramjets Understand flight at speeds greater than Mach 5 and discover how to analyse the performance of a scramjet.

The Importance of SDG 11 ** Professor Sachs talks about the ideas and thought-processes that are used to work towards achieving sustainable cities. He elaborates the circumstances in which SDG 11 was created, and uses current data to estimate future global needs and the expectations that must be fulfilled to establish sustainable cities. The outcomes of modifying and designing cities for the increasing world population are also elaborated. **Module 3: The 10-Point Agenda for 21st-Century Cities ** Professor Sachs discusses the pros and cons of advancements in science and technology. He outlines a 10-point agenda for sustainable cities and discusses each topic individually to elaborate the breadth and depth of this complex issue. Module 4: Urban Environment and Energy SystemsProfessor Sachs highlights the escalating issues due to climate change and pollution and establishes the urgent need to achieve clean and smart cities. To illustrate the limited timeline under which sustainability must be achieved, he uses current data to forecast possible future solutions. Thismodule also includes examples of new methods and cutting-edge technologies that can be used to achieve SDG 11. **Module 5: Cities as Hubs of Knowledge ** This concludingmodule draws on the cross-cutting issues previously discussed, including the importance of developing urban settlements into smart, shared spaces that foster creativity and knowledge growth. Using case studies, Professor Sachs provides further examples of how this is being done across the world, and how this method can be applied in the future.","course_url":"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/course\/cities-and-the-challenge-of-sustainable-developmen","text":"Cities and the Challenge of Sustainable Development What is a sustainable city?
